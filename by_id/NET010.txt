QUESTION: What do interface flags like UP, LOWER_UP, LOOPBACK, BROADCAST mean?
ANSWER: UP = interface is enabled. LOWER_UP = physical layer is up (cable plugged in). LOOPBACK = loopback interface. BROADCAST = can send to all devices on network. MULTICAST = can send to group of devices. Missing LOWER_UP with UP means cable unplugged!
