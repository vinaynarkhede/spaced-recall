QUESTION: WHAT is a gateway? WHY is it needed and what happens when you try to reach an IP outside your network?
ANSWER: <b>DEFINITION:</b> The "exit door" from your local network to reach other networks.<br><br><b>WHY IT'S NEEDED:</b><br>Your computer knows IPs on its local network (e.g., 192.168.1.x)<br>But it has NO IDEA how to reach 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS)<br>Gateway = "I don't know how to reach this, ask this router"<br><br><b>HOW IT WORKS:</b><br>1. Packet to 142.250.185.46 (google.com)<br>2. Routing table: not in local network<br>3. Falls to default route: gateway 192.168.1.1<br>4. Packet sent to router<br>5. Router knows how to forward to internet<br><br><b>IN ROUTING TABLE:</b><br>• Gateway = 0.0.0.0 means "directly connected"<br>• Gateway = 192.168.1.1 means "send to this IP first"<br><br><b>KEY INSIGHT:</b> Your home router is your default gateway. Corporate networks may have multiple gateways for different subnets.
