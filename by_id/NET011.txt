DECK: Networking::linux_namespaces
QUESTION: What is a Linux network namespace?
ANSWER: A copy of the entire network stack, isolated from other copies. Each namespace has its own: network interfaces, IP addresses, routing tables, firewall rules (iptables), port bindings. Enables multiple apps to use port 80 without conflict.
