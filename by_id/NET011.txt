DECK: Networking::linux_namespaces
QUESTION: WHY do Linux network namespaces exist? What specific problem do they solve for containers?
ANSWER: <b>THE PROBLEM:</b><br>On a single Linux system:<br>• Only ONE process can bind to port 80<br>• All processes share the same routing table<br>• All processes share the same firewall rules<br>• All processes see the same network interfaces<br><br>IMPACT: Can't run multiple isolated network services.<br><br><b>THE SOLUTION - NETWORK NAMESPACES:</b><br>Give each container/app its OWN:<br>1. Network interfaces (its own eth0, lo)<br>2. IP addresses<br>3. Routing tables<br>4. Firewall rules (iptables)<br>5. Port bindings<br><br>RESULT: Each container is like a separate computer, network-wise.<br><br><b>REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE:</b><br>• Container A: nginx on port 80<br>• Container B: apache on port 80<br>• Container C: python http.server on port 80<br>All running simultaneously, no conflict!<br><br><b>KEY INSIGHT:</b> This is THE foundational technology for container networking.
