QUESTION: WHAT is the principle "isolation by default, connection by choice"? How does it apply to container networking?
ANSWER: <b>THE PRINCIPLE:</b><br>Start with COMPLETE isolation (security).<br>Connect ONLY what needs to communicate (functionality).<br>Control EXACTLY how they communicate (firewall, routing).<br><br><b>APPLICATION TO CONTAINERS:</b><br><br><b>DEFAULT STATE:</b><br>• Container starts in isolated namespace<br>• No connection to host network<br>• No connection to other containers<br>• Can't be reached from outside<br><br><b>YOU CHOOSE TO CONNECT:</b><br>• -p 8080:80 → Expose specific port<br>• --network mynet → Join Docker network<br>• --link db → Connect to container<br>• --network host → Full access (least secure)<br><br><b>SECURITY BENEFIT:</b><br>• Container compromise doesn't expose other services<br>• Explicit connections = auditable attack surface<br><br><b>KEY INSIGHT:</b> This is why you CAN'T reach a container unless you explicitly expose it. It's a feature, not a bug.<br><br><b>ANTI-PATTERN:</b> --network host "for convenience" removes all isolation benefits.
