DECK: Networking::linux_namespaces
QUESTION: Why is "isolation by default, connection by choice" the namespace principle?
ANSWER: Start with complete isolation (security). Connect only what needs to communicate (functionality). Control exactly how they communicate (firewall rules, routing). This enables container security while allowing necessary communication.
