QUESTION: WHY do network interfaces exist in Linux? What problem do they solve?
ANSWER: <b>PROBLEM:</b> A computer needs multiple "doors" to send/receive traffic - one for local communication, others for external networks, VPNs, containers, etc.<br><br><b>SOLUTION:</b> Network interfaces are abstracted "doors" for traffic.<br><br><b>TWO TYPES:</b><br>• Physical interfaces (eth0, wlan0) - connected to hardware<br>• Virtual interfaces (lo, veth, docker0) - created by software<br><br><b>NAMING CONVENTION:</b><br>• eth0, eth1 = Ethernet (wired)<br>• wlan0 = Wireless LAN (WiFi)<br>• lo = Loopback (always 127.0.0.1)<br><br><b>KEY INSIGHT:</b> Interfaces aren't just hardware - they're an ABSTRACTION that lets Linux treat virtual network paths the same as physical ones. This is what makes containers possible.
