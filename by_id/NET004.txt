QUESTION: What does CIDR notation like /24 mean?
ANSWER: It tells how many bits are the "network" part of the IP address. /24 = first 24 bits are network, remaining 8 bits for hosts = 2^8 = 256 addresses. /16 = 65,536 addresses. /8 = 16,777,216 addresses. Example: 192.168.1.100/24 means network is 192.168.1.x
