DECK: ComputerArchitecture::cpu_fundamentals
QUESTION: What is a transistor and why is it the fundamental building block of all computation?
ANSWER: A transistor is an electrically controlled switch. Apply voltage to the gate terminal → current flows between other terminals. Gate=1 (high voltage) → Switch ON → Output=1. Gate=0 (low voltage) → Switch OFF → Output=0. All computation is built by combining these switches.
