DECK: Networking::linux_namespaces
QUESTION: How do you create and manage a Linux network namespace?
ANSWER: Create: sudo ip netns add blue. List: ip netns list. Delete: sudo ip netns delete blue. Execute command inside: sudo ip netns exec blue ip addr. New namespace starts with only loopback (lo) interface, which must be brought up manually.
