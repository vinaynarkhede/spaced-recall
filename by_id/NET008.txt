QUESTION: WHAT is a network bridge (like docker0)? HOW is it different from a router?
ANSWER: <b>DEFINITION:</b> A virtual switch that connects multiple network segments, allowing devices to communicate as if on the same network.<br><br><b>BRIDGE VS ROUTER:</b><br>• Bridge (Layer 2): Connects devices on SAME network using MAC addresses<br>• Router (Layer 3): Connects DIFFERENT networks using IP addresses<br><br><b>HOW docker0 BRIDGE WORKS:</b><br>1. Docker creates virtual bridge "docker0" (default 172.17.0.1)<br>2. Each container gets a veth pair<br>3. One end in container (eth0), other end on docker0<br>4. Containers can talk via bridge<br>5. Bridge connects to host's real interface for external access<br><br><b>VISUAL:</b><br>Container1 (172.17.0.2) ──┐<br>                          ├── docker0 ── eth0 ── internet<br>Container2 (172.17.0.3) ──┘<br><br><b>KEY INSIGHT:</b> docker0 is why containers can reach each other using 172.17.0.x IPs and why you can reach containers from the host.
