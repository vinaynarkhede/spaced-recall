QUESTION: WHAT is the loopback interface (lo)? Why does EVERY system have one and what problem does it solve?
ANSWER: <b>DEFINITION:</b> A virtual interface that always points back to the same computer. IP: 127.0.0.1 (localhost).<br><br><b>THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES:</b><br>Without loopback: Programs need special IPC code to talk locally<br>With loopback: Programs use SAME networking code for local and remote<br><br><b>WHY EVERY SYSTEM HAS ONE:</b><br>1. Testing servers without a network<br>2. Inter-process communication (database connections)<br>3. Services binding to localhost for security<br>4. Development (localhost:3000)<br><br><b>KEY DIFFERENCES FROM eth0:</b><br>• lo: Traffic NEVER leaves the computer<br>• eth0: Traffic goes to physical network<br>• lo: Always 127.0.0.1/8<br>• eth0: Assigned IP (e.g., 192.168.1.100)<br><br><b>COMMON USE:</b> mysql -h 127.0.0.1 connects via loopback even though MySQL is on same machine.
