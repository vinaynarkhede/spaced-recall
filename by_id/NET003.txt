QUESTION: What are the three major private IP ranges defined by RFC 1918?
ANSWER: 10.0.0.0/8 (Class A, 16M addresses - large networks), 172.16.0.0/12 (Class B, 1M addresses - Docker/WSL2), 192.168.0.0/16 (Class C, 65K addresses - home networks). These are free to use, not routable on the internet, and NAT translates them to public IPs.
