# Memory Hierarchy - First Principles
MEM001	What is a flip-flop and why is it fundamental to memory?	A flip-flop is the simplest memory element made from logic gates where output loops back to input, creating stable state. Once set, it retains value until actively changed. Foundation of all static memory (SRAM).
MEM002	What is the memory hierarchy and why does it exist?	Hierarchical design from fastest/smallest to slowest/largest: Registers (1 cycle) → L1 Cache (4-5 cycles) → L2 Cache (10-20 cycles) → L3 Cache (30-50 cycles) → RAM (100+ cycles) → SSD/HDD (100,000+ cycles). Exists because fast memory is expensive, cheap memory is slow.
MEM003	Why is it called "Random Access Memory" (RAM)?	Because you can access any memory location directly by its address, without reading through everything before it (unlike sequential storage like tape). Any address accessible in same amount of time.
MEM004	How does DRAM store data and why does it need refreshing?	DRAM stores each bit as charge in a tiny capacitor: charged=1, discharged=0. Capacitors leak charge, so DRAM must be refreshed thousands of times per second — reading each bit and writing it back to prevent data loss.
MEM005	What are the three types of buses connecting CPU to memory?	1. Data Bus: Carries actual data (width = data per transfer). 2. Address Bus: Carries memory addresses (32-bit=4GB, 64-bit=16 exabytes). 3. Control Bus: Carries read/write signals, clock, interrupts.
MEM006	What is the principle of locality and its two types?	Temporal Locality: Data accessed now will likely be accessed again soon. Spatial Locality: Data near recently accessed addresses will likely be accessed soon. Caches exploit both — loading cache lines (64 bytes) at once.
MEM007	What is cache hit vs cache miss and why does it matter?	Cache Hit: Data found in cache → fast access. Cache Miss: Data not in cache → must fetch from slower memory. Cache-friendly algorithms can be 10-100x faster than cache-unfriendly ones with same Big-O complexity.
MEM008	How much faster is L1 cache compared to RAM?	L1 cache: 4-5 CPU cycles. RAM: 100+ CPU cycles. L1 is roughly 20-25x faster than RAM. This is why cache is critical for performance.
