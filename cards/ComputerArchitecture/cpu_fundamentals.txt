# CPU Fundamentals - First Principles
CPU001	What is a transistor and why is it the fundamental building block of all computation?	A transistor is an electrically controlled switch. Apply voltage to the gate terminal → current flows between other terminals. Gate=1 (high voltage) → Switch ON → Output=1. Gate=0 (low voltage) → Switch OFF → Output=0. All computation is built by combining these switches.
CPU002	Why do computers use binary (0s and 1s) instead of other number systems?	Binary is physics-based choice for reliability. Distinguishing between two voltage levels (high/low) is noise-resistant. Using 10 different voltage levels would introduce errors. Binary is the most robust way to encode information using electricity.
CPU003	What are the five main logic gates and their functions?	AND: Output 1 only if BOTH inputs are 1. OR: Output 1 if EITHER input is 1. NOT: Flips input (1→0, 0→1). XOR: Output 1 if inputs are DIFFERENT. NAND: NOT AND — universal gate (can build any function).
CPU004	What is functional completeness and why is NAND gate special?	Functional completeness means you can build ANY logical function from a set of gates. NAND gate alone is functionally complete — your entire computer could theoretically be built from just NAND gates.
CPU005	What is a half adder and how does it work?	A half adder adds two 1-bit numbers using logic gates. Sum = A XOR B. Carry = A AND B. Example: 1+1 → Sum=0, Carry=1 (binary 10). Chain multiple adders to add larger numbers.
CPU006	What are the four core components of a CPU?	1. ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit): Math and logic operations. 2. Registers: Ultra-fast storage inside CPU. 3. Control Unit: Reads/decodes instructions, orchestrates operations. 4. Clock: Generates steady pulse synchronizing operations (3.5 GHz = 3.5 billion pulses/sec).
CPU007	What are the three types of registers in a CPU?	1. General purpose registers: Store data being worked on. 2. Instruction register: Holds current instruction. 3. Program counter (PC): Holds address of next instruction to execute.
CPU008	Describe the Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle.	1. FETCH: Read instruction from memory at address in Program Counter, increment PC. 2. DECODE: Control Unit interprets instruction — what operation, what data, where. 3. EXECUTE: ALU performs operation, results stored. Repeat billions of times per second.
CPU009	What is machine code and what is an ISA?	Machine code is raw binary patterns the CPU directly understands. ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) is the machine code format specific to each CPU architecture (x86, ARM, RISC-V). Programs compiled for one ISA won't run on another.
CPU010	What does "3.5 GHz" mean for a CPU?	The clock generates 3.5 billion pulses per second. Each pulse is an opportunity to do work — synchronizes all CPU operations. Higher frequency = more operations per second (generally).
