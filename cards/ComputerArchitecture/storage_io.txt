# Storage and I/O - First Principles
STO001	How do HDDs store data and why are they slow?	HDDs store data magnetically on spinning platters. Read/write head moves to track. Slow because: 1. Seek time (head moving). 2. Rotational latency (waiting for sector). Mechanical movement = milliseconds = millions of CPU cycles.
STO002	How do SSDs store data using flash memory?	SSDs use floating gate transistors — electrons are trapped in a gate to represent 1 or 0. No moving parts = much faster (especially random access). Limited write cycles as electrons degrade oxide layer.
STO003	What is the speed difference between HDD and SSD for random reads?	HDD Random Read: 5-10 ms. SSD Random Read: 0.1 ms. SSD is 50-100x faster for random access because no mechanical movement required.
STO004	What is DMA and why is it important?	DMA (Direct Memory Access) allows peripherals to transfer data to/from memory without CPU involvement. CPU tells DMA controller: "Transfer 1MB from disk X to memory Y" — controller handles it, freeing CPU. Sends interrupt when done.
STO005	What's the difference between polling and interrupts for I/O?	Polling: CPU constantly checks "did something happen?" — wasteful, burns CPU cycles. Interrupts: Device sends signal when it needs attention — efficient, CPU does other work until interrupted.
STO006	What is Memory-Mapped I/O vs Port-Mapped I/O?	Memory-Mapped: Devices assigned addresses in same space as memory — simpler, uses same load/store instructions. Port-Mapped: Separate address space with special IN/OUT instructions — more complex, keeps memory space clean.
STO007	What is volatile vs non-volatile storage?	Volatile: Loses data when power removed (RAM, registers, cache). Non-volatile: Retains data without power (HDD, SSD, flash). RAM is fast but temporary; storage is persistent but slower.
STO008	What happens when you run a program (storage to execution)?	1. Executable on SSD. 2. OS instructs disk controller. 3. DMA transfers bytes to RAM. 4. OS sets up memory (code, data, stack). 5. CPU fetches instructions from RAM. 6. Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle begins.
